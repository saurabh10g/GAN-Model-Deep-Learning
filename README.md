A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a deep learning model designed to generate new data instances that resemble a given dataset. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, engaged in an adversarial training process. The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator evaluates its authenticity, forming a continuous loop of improvement. Through adversarial training, GANs learn to generate realistic data, such as images, audio, or text, by capturing the underlying patterns and distributions of the training set. GANs have found applications in various fields, including image synthesis, style transfer, and data augmentation.
